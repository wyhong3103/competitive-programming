This problem is about choosing f days to double the product, and getting the maximum sell over n days. So, we need to select the day the will gives us most profit.The idea is to select element that gives us the most when it's being compared to not being doubled.
<br>
Explanation:
-  So first off, we got k and l, k is the number of product we got for that day, l is the number of customer we have that day.
- When we received 2 of these numbers, we can do this simple operation, to determine the profit we will get if we doubled it.
```
min(k,l) = Total product we will be selling if we didn't double it, because if we have k products but less l, every customer will get one product, and there wil be extra product, if l > k, only k customer can get the product.

So, with this observation, we can get to know the number of product which will be sold if we double it ,
min(k * 2, l)

With these 2 value, we simply need to use the second one subtract the first one, and we will get the profit we made.
```
- After doing this operation to each and every pair, we can sort it by the profit.
- Select f product with its profit, then the rest without the profit.

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#include <limits>

	freopen((s + ".in").c_str(),"r",stdin);
	freopen((s + ".out").c_str(),"w",stdout);
	}


void solve(){
    int n, f;
    cin >> n >> f;
    
    vector<pair<ll,ll>> a(n);
    //fir = number before double,sec = +number after double

    for(auto& i : a){
        cin >> i.fir >> i.sec;
        if (i.fir > i.sec){
            i.fir = i.sec;
        }
        if ((i.fir * 2) < i.sec){
            i.sec = i.fir * 2; 
        }
        i.sec -= i.fir;
    }

    sort(all(a), [](pi a, pi b){
        return a.sec > b.sec;
    });

    
    ll ans = 0;
    for(auto& i : a){
        if (f){
            ans += i.sec;
            f-=1;
        }
        ans += i.fir;
    }

    cout << ans;
