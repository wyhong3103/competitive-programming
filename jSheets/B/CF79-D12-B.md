B is really implementation heavy! Damn!

So this problem is about looking for the right fruits planted on the cell. Considering that there is wasted cell.
<br>
My approach:
- It's basically impossible to do it with an actual array, because of the size, so I just decided not to do it, and do it with some math.
- So first off, we know that there will be wasted cells. And one way to store it is using hash map, row as key, column as value(it's a vector, because we want to store every col in that row), we do this for a reason. At the same time, we will have an array that keeps track of the non-wasted cell on that row.
- Second, we have to know the starting fruit of each row, so the way to do it is to, use the last row's starting fruit + last row total non-wasted cell modulo the number of fruit.
```
Eg.

row -	non-wasted cell
1 	- 	4
2 	- 	4
3 	- 	3
4 	- 	4

First row always start with 0 (Here we use 0 represent Carrot, 1 represent Kiwi, 2 Grape)

i - (i-1 th's starting number + i-1 th non-wasted cells) % 3

1 - 0
2 - (0 + 4) % 3 = 1
3 - (1 + 4) % 3 = 2
4 - (2 + 3) % 3 = 2
```
- After doing this operation to each row, it's time to get query.
- If the selected row, selected column is a wasted cell then print Wasted.
- For every query, if the selected row, has wasted cell, we will have to iterate through the hash map with wasted cells, and get the number of wasted cells before the selected column.
- After that, we simply do 
```
(starting number + selected column - 1 - wasted cells before selected column) % 3

Selected column needed to -1, because we need the selected column, not the one after it.

0 - Carrots
1 - Kiwis
2 - Grapes
```
