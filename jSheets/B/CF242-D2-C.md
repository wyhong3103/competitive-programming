I felt like I have overcomplicated this problem. Anyways , the main techniques used in this problem is coordinate compression, prefix sum, difference array, binary search, and bfs. I felt like I used a lot of techniques lol. Anyways here is the approach,

Explanation:
```
You can basically know that it's impossible to use an actual grid to solve this problem, because of the size of the input. So , we need to compress the coordinate. And also, there are certain range of allowed cell, to do this in a quicker fashion, is to use a differnce array, because again, we can't afford the memory of using an entire array of 10^9 or even more. So the idea is to

Create a difference array for the range of cells that we're allowed to use, then prefix sum them. If the value is <= 0, we simply just can't access the cells, so return -1. We are not always going to reach a cell that is specified in the range update query, so we need to use binary search to look for the column that is strictly before us, if it's value is > 0, that means we can access the cell.

Say our prefix sum array (not really a prefix sum array, remember that when you construct an array from difference array you got the actual array) for that row is 

{column number, value}

{1,1} {5,2} {6,2} {9,0} 

^This might not be an accurate prefix sum array, bu that's the idea

Say we're looking for 8th column, the one that is strictly before it is 6, 6's value is 2 (that means it has been mentioned twice in the range update query)

So it's a valid cell to travel to.

This is the idea for checking the validity of the cell. Then, all we need to do is do BFS, since we cannot use a 2D array to keep track of distance and visited cells. We're going to use a set and a hash map to deal with it. And that's the idea!
