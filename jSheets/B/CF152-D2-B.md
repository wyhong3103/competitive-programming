So this problem is about travelling as much as we could with a step(vector) before we hit the border we have to stop, basically.
```
My approach is simply using geometry

Say we have a field size of 4x4, and we at (1,1)

XXXX
XXXX
XXXX
OXXX

And our vector is (1,1), instead of checking where we lands, (that's too slow), we can check the border we're going to hit, in this case is x = 4, and y = 4, because v_i and v_j is both positive it's going to travel diagonally, eventually hit x = 4 or y = 4, so to find out which are we going to hit first, we're going to have to understand one thing

No matter which direction we're travelling, we can always focus on the x and y axis independently

what does that mean? So in the case of (1,1) and the step(vector) of (1,1), field size of 4x4, the best we could do is 3

XXXO
XXOX
XOXX
OXXX

Notice that if we only focus on movement on x-axis

OOOO

It spits out the same thing, therefore we can check every border independently , and get the best we could do , code below demonstrates it

if (i > 0){
	count = min(count, (n-x)/i);
}
if (i < 0){
    count = min(count, abs((x-1)/i));
}
if (j > 0){
    count = min(count, (m-y)/j);
}
if (j < 0){
    count = min(count, abs((y-1)/j));
}

```
