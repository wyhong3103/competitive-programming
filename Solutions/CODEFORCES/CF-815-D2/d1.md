Did not solve this during contest, but is like super close.
```
Anyways, my idea was

let a[b[i] = o, a[b[i+1]] = p, b[i] = q , b[i+1] = r

in order for 

r XOR o < p XOR q

Notice that, r is always bigger than q

The only way for q to be bigger than r, is that o must cancel out some of the bits in r

But that's not the case when q and r has more than 9 bits, which is bigger than > digit 200 (a[i] <= 200), this is because when q and r is more than those bits, the leading bit cannot be cancelled.

With this observation we know that, the difference between q and r cannot be more than a certain range, let it be 512.

But this is not the full solution, I got close, yet so far.

##### From the editorial

Observation:
- a[i] does not change b[i]/b[i+1] more than 200

so ur requirement is (p xor q) < (r xor s)
is equivalent to (r xor s) - (p xor q) > 0
and from the 1st statement, you know that this value will be at least
(r - 200) - (p + 200) (since it changes the value by at most 200)
(r - 200) - (p + 200) > 0 implies r - p > 400

So yeah, kind of the same thing we got from our observation.

The difference between b[i] and b[i+1] cannot be more than 400

So a very simple thing to do(which I do not figure out during contest)


Is by using LIS O(N^2) technique	

For each i, we only need to connect the subsequence from i-512.

And the answer is simply the maximum among all.
