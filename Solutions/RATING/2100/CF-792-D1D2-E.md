Let final MEX = x, answer is essentially distinct number >= x


Idea is to try every MEX

Let's say we want MEX = x, and there are y numbers that is < x, that we're missing

How to get the minimal answer for MEX = x?

First we need to make sure, y <= k

if total numbers >= MEX is >= k, then 

we simply need to find the minimal distinct number that is >= x, we could remain after removing k numbers that is >= x

how to find that?

It's a little hard to do query on this one, so the idea is to preprocess the minimal distinct number if current mex <= x

Code is pretty self explanatory

// cnt is the frequency table of every number given
auto it = cnt.rbegin();
int cur = 0;
int processed = 0;
multiset<int> ms;
while(it != cnt.rend()){
	// if we can take we take
    if (cur + it->sec <= k){
        ms.insert(it->sec);
        cur += it->sec;
    }
    // trade for the biggest
    else if (sz(ms) && it->sec < *(--ms.end())){
        cur -= *(--ms.end());
        ms.erase(--ms.end());
        ms.insert(it->sec);
        cur += it->sec;
    }

    processed++;
    // minimal distinct number we could still have
    res[it->fir] = processed - sz(ms);
    it++;
}

say MEX = x and total numbers >= x is >= y, the answer is simply the answer for the above for the closest number >= x

The next case is when total numbers >= x is < y, in that case, if the sum of total duplicated numbers < x and total numbers >= x is >= y, then mn is simply 0

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define all(x) begin(x),end(x)
#define fir first
#define sec second

/*

diff - mex will never < 0
given current MEX = x

means we do not have x, and we have every number < x

if we do not consider number > x, that's our current answer

answer is basically, total diff number > mex, we want to minimize that

how?

greedy, take the last k numbers, and try to fit them inside mex, 

reason is simple,

we can move k numbers, the first few numbers might be able to fit in the MEX
