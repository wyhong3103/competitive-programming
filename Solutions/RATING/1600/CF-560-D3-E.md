Another pretty intresting problem. Can be solved with math & greedy.
```
First thing first, 

We're asked to find the smallest sum of all subarray

So let us ask ourself what is the best possible way to find the sum of all subarray

Say we got 

1,2,3,4,5

And this is how the subarray is going to look like



1,2,3,4,5

If you count how many time each element is included in the subarray, you will get the below

5 8 9 8 5

first element and fifth element is going to be included 5 times
second and forth element is going to be included 8 times
and the third element 9 times

We can find these numbers in O(N)

let ripple = the longest length of the subarray from i to the end of the array
let total_ripple = number of i-th element that has contributed to the ripple

ripple of 1st element in the last example is 4, including himself ,it's 5, total_ripple++
for second element, it's going to be part of the ripple of the 1st element, with it's own ripple = 3, so the number of times it's going to get included in the subarray is past ripples(ripple) + n-i,
And the ripple has to add n-i-1, total_ripple++

At each iteration, we have to deduct the ripple by total_ripple, because at each iteration, there will be total_ripple ripple be gone


Now let's talk about the part where we have to match the a[i] with b[i] and result the minimal value

A general way of minimizing this is to simply , for every i, just match the smallest element of b with the biggest element of a (simply sort them)

While this could've worked, but we have to consider the number of times a[i] is going to be included!

So we have to multiply every a[i] by included[i] (It's important to know that we could not MOD here , because this will ruin the greedy after that, and it's proven that long long can contain the biggest number of a[i] and included[i], so it's fine)

One error I did is , when you're having a long long array, you must use greater<ll>() instead of greater<int>() as the comparator
```

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define all(x) begin(x),end(x)
#define fir first
#define sec second
#define sz(x) x.size()
#define pb push_back
 
using namespace std;
using vi = vector<int>;
using pi = pair<int,int>;
using ll = long long;
const double EPS = (1e-7);
 
void setio(string s){
	freopen((s + ".in").c_str(),"r",stdin);
	freopen((s + ".out").c_str(),"w",stdout);
}

const int MOD = 998244353;


void solve(){
    int n;
    cin >> n;

    vector<ll> a(n);
    for(auto& i : a) cin >> i;
    vector<ll> b(n);
    for(auto& i : b) cin >> i;

    //Number of times an element is going to be included in the subarray    
    vector<ll> included(n);
    ll ripple = 0;
    ll total_ripple = 0;
    for(int i{}; i < n; i++){
        included[i] += (n-i);
        included[i] += ripple;
        ripple += n-i-1;
        ripple -= total_ripple;
        total_ripple++;
    }

    for(int i{}; i < n; i++){
        a[i] *= included[i];
    }

    sort(all(a), greater<ll>());
    sort(all(b));

    ll res = 0;
    for(int i{}; i < n; i++){
        res += ((a[i] % MOD) * (b[i] % MOD))% MOD;
        res %= MOD;
    }

    cout << res;
}

int main(){
	ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
	cin.tie(nullptr);
    solve();
	return 0;
}
