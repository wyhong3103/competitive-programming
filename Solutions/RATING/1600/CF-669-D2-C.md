The main observation is that say we got 2 numbers

pi and pj, since they are going to be different, there must be one number that is bigger than other

say we got 2 and 3

2 mod 3 = we get 2 , which is always guaranteed that we will got the original number back (if the number is smaller than the mod)

3 mod 2 , we are going to get 1, (this number is guaranteed to be smaller than the original number)

So with 2 numbers, we can determine one of the 2 numbers

So we can do this 2 pointer thing

say n = 5, initialize every number as -1

-1 -1 -1 -1 -1

we're going to stop if the second pointer, has reached the end, that means we cannot find another number that is unfound

If we found one number we set p1 = p2, and move p2 until it hit an unfound number

At the end, there will be one number that is -1, and that number is the largest number.
