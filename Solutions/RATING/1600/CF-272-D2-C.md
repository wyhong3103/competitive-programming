This problem is asking for the sum of all nice integers

An integer is nice if div(x,b)/mod(x,b) <= a
 
div(x,b) stands for quotient for x/b

We're given a,b , we are to search for x and find the sum of all x

Well let's break down the problem

x/b = q + r/b

q is apparently div(x,b), and r is mod(x,b)

Notice that there could only be b-1 number of r values, this is because mod(x,b) cannot be 0

And because we're only looking for the integer when div(x,b) % mod(x,b) == 0, so, it's obvious right now that, div(x,b) is the multiple of mod(x, b)

And one more thing is that div(x,b)/ mod(x,b) has to be <= a

So apparently for each remainder value, there is 'a' number of quotients that are valid

But how do we find the sum of them?

Let's say we got a = 3, b = 3

When r = 1

There could be 3 value for quotient(div(x,b)), which is 1, 2, and 3, because all of them, divide 1, and they are <= a

Let's translate it into actual x, 
when quotient = 1, r = 1, x = (r * quotient * b) + r, x = 4

Formula (r * quotient * b) + rcomes from below

When remainder = 2, because each quotient is the mutiple of 2, so we need to multiply them by 2, and multiply by b, because that's how we could make them as quotient, and then plus the remainder


when quotient = 2, r = 1, x = (2*3) + 1, x = 7
same thing goes to quotient = 3

When r = 2
when quotient = 1, r = 2, x = (r * quotient * b) + r, x = (2 * 1 * 3) + 2 = 8, as 8/3 = 2 + 2/3


Well there's a pattern here

For each remainder, 

Because we're looking for 'a' numbers of quotient for each remainder, so we got formula below

b * i * ( (a*(a+1))/2 ) + r

Now this algorithm runs in O(N), the only tricky part is the modulus part, which is extremely annoying
