This problem was about removing a certain suffix (zero or more).

Note that, if a becaon is triggered, then it will only destroy those in the range, and let the very next becaon activate, and so on, as long as a becaon is triggered, the becaons that are going to be triggered after it will trigger. (no matter how long the suffix is destroyed)

Now this kind of formed a directed graph.

1 9
3 1
6 1
7 4

For this case, it formed a graph like this

7 --> 1
	  ^
	  |
	  3
	  ^
	  |
	  6

If we are to start from 7, we will reach the end in just distance 1, but if we removed it, we will start from 6 instead, and we will end in distance 2.

Notice that if 6 is removed, 3 will still be triggered, and kind of reach the same result.

So the idea is to simply find the longest connected component (kind of). And to avoid visiting repeated node, we can use a distance array that stores the distance from node i to the end.

And the answer is simply the longest length+1.

Now this might be obvious that , this could be solved by using dp.
