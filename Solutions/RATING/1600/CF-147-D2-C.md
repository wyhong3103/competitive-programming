Before explaining the solution, let's talk about it's very annoying problem statement.

```
Find the minimum l such as

For every number, x from a to b-l+1, 
x,x+1,...x+l-1 has at least k prime numbers

That literally means

From integer a to b-l+1, every integer must have k prime numbers at least,

So the thing is we have to determine the minimum L we can obtain, to make sure we've fulfilled the condition

One observation is that, say one of the number, x requires l of 4 to obtain at least k prime numbers, if any number that is > x and > b-4+1 straight up became invalid, also, in order for x to be valid, every number before x has to be valid as well.

So to solve it, we can greedy it

First, we need to generate the list of prime, we can do this in O(N) using sieve of eratosthenes

Then, iterate from a to b, use a variable to store the maximum length, and just make sure we don't iterate through number that is > b+1-l

(Literally no proof, it just works)

A more sensible way of coding this is

	ll ans = INT_MAX;
    ll temp = -1;
    for(int i{a}; i <= b; i++){
        int cur = lower_bound(all(primes), i) - primes.begin();
        if (cur+(k-1) >= sz(primes) || i > (b+1)-temp){
            if (temp > -1) ans = min(ans, max(temp, b+1-(i-1)));
            break;
        }
        temp = max(temp, primes[cur+k-1]-i+1);
        ans = min(ans, max(primes[cur+(k-1)]-i+1, b+1-i));
    }

Use a variable 'ans' to store the minimum answer, at any point, it's either the length to meet the k-th, or b+1-i (assuming if we're going to stop there), and another variable to store the current maximum length , and make sure we don't exceed it, because in oreder to reach x, x must not exceed the maximum l from the number before it.
