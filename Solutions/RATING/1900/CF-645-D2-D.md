To deal with cycles, we can simply extend the array by twice! 

Since x <= sum(d)

So how do we find the best segment?

We can fix each left starting point (month)! from day 1.


|1 2 ...... 1 2 3| ... n

Say the range in ||, is the segment we currently have, which is length x!, it is always optimal to abandon some on the left (1 2 ... z) to get something on the right which is bigger! (3+1 ... 3+z... n in this case) 

We should not consider abandoning a 1 for another month that starts with 1! Because that will always gives us a lesser answer!

Think about this, since we only concerning how much of the days in the starting month are we taking, if we are to give up some of them for another prefix of (1....n) it is simply not worth it, because we could get the same sum without changing anything!

So that's the solution!

We can do binary search with some prefix sum to get the answer.
