First let's observe how the tree grows.

1

child[0] - 1

2

child[0] - 1
child[1] - 1


3

child[0] - 3
child[1] - 1
child[3] - 1

4

child[0] - 5
child[1] - 3
child[3] - 2

5

child[0] - 11
child[1] - 5
child[3] - 5

number of 0 - previous child that has 1 * 2 + previous child that has 0 node
number of 1 - previous child that has 0
number of 3 - previous child that has 1

We want the maximal claws that is not intersected at all!

Note that it's always optimal to choose the bottom most claws (i.e the one that is just developed at current level)

Proof : 

Let claw i be the leaf claw, and p[i] be the parent of claw i's center

It's obvious that if we take claw i, we cant take p[i], which is also a center of a claw.

There is nothing below claw i, so if we take claw i, whatever p[i] can take above it, we can also take it! So there's basically no harm.

Solution

So right now, it's obvious that everytime we need to take the leaf claws.

But how do we select the parent claws?? We can do dynamic programming, at level i, if we are to take the claw that just developed at level i, it is guaranteed that all the claws we took at level i-3, will not be affected at all. 

Think of it like this, each claw will only be fully developed in 3 steps. 

Let's observe the center of the claw,

first it got produced, it has 0 children

second it produce one children

third it produce two more children, hence becoming center of a claw.

At level i-3, center i has not been produced yet! Therefore if we are to take it, nothing will be affected.
