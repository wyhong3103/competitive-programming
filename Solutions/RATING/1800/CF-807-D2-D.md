Notice that each operation we could only toggle a bit if s[i-1] != s[i+1]

00010000

If we have the above string, we could actually extend the 1 to both l and r, but never till both ends!

00111110

There is no possible way that we could remove all the 1s! There's always one left!

Everytime we toggle a 1, we got a new 0, vice versa.

With this observation, we could kind of compress the string into

1010 form, remove all the character from that is equal to s[i-1]

for the string, 0010000, compressed form = 010

We can only turn s into t, if they have the same compressed form!

So now how do we turn s into t?

Well we can greedy it!

4
0100
0010

Take this example first,

For the first 0,

s has 1, and t has 2

We need one more 0 for s, we can look at the next number that is diff which is 1, but the frequency of it is just 1 and we cannot remove from it! So we will have to search for the next number that has frequency > 1, which is the last 0!

We will take it and then add it to our current 0! And the cost is just

total taken * (index of it in compressed form - index of current number in compressed form)

Because that's how much we need to move from there to here!

So right now, we have a solution for cases where cnt_s[i] < cnt_t[i]

Let's look at another example,

6
000101
010011

Compressed = 0101

cnt_s[first 0] > cnt_t[first 0]

This is even simpler, we can just throw the extras to the next number!

The question comes, how do we do the first greedy way??

Well we can actually store all {i, cnt[i]} in a set, and have them sorted by i. (we can't use a normal array, because we would definitely get TLE for searching the extra element). But we won't get TLE in here, because the maximal time we're going to be taking a number from the future number is N.

Our sorted set do not consist of any number that has cnt[i] <= 1. (because that is not considered as extra!)
