Abridged statement :

We can make the set of circles into two sets. We are to find the maximal area included.

An area of circle is included iff including itself, and the number of circles that covered it is an odd number. Else it is not included.

Solution :

Turned out the optimal answer is just by moving the largest circle that is not contained by any circle to another set, and we will get the optimal answer.

Proof : 

It is pretty much always optimal to split the largest out. But how to see if its optimal?

Let's have circle a, b, c, d. a containing b, b containing c and so forth.

The intial area is a - b + c - d

If we are to split the large cycle, our are would become

(a) + (b - c + d)

How to see we cannot make any optimal than this??

We can start looking from b,

b is either in its current set, or with a, if we are to move b into a, our area would be

(a - b) + (c - d), which is obviously smaller than the previous answer because, the sum of the entire area wouldn't be bigger than a, because b is subtracted from a, and c is not bigger than b! (When a circle contain another circle, the total area computed wont be bigger than the area of the outest circle)

What about c,

(a - c) + (b - d)

a + b - c + d > a - c + b - d

So it is not optimal to do that.

Lets see d,

(a - d) + (b - c)

a + b - c + d > a - d + b - c

Basically no matter how we move the inner circle, it wouldn't make the answer any better.

**** Proof probably? 

If the current circle is not included in plane 1, but its included in plane 2.

moving this to plane 2 would only make it lesser, the proof is above.

If the current circle is included in plane 1, and included in plane 2, no reason to move it.
