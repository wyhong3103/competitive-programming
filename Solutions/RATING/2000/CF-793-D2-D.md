First let's prove that only when there's an even number of 1s it would work.

A connected graph only exists iff number of degree is an even number.

If we have an odd number of 1s, we would have total degree = odd + even = odd, which violate the condition.

Also, when there is 0 number of 1s, it is also impossible to construct a tree.

Now with this condition, how do we construct a correct solution that is guaranteed to always be working?

I found this solution through trial and error, what's the general approach to find it? I have no idea

The idea is we can connect up every even segment, let {a, b} be the head and tail of that segment, it is guaranteed that there will always bit 1s next to it.

We can always connect our tail to the maximal odd number of 1s.

So if there is a contiguous segment which is an even length of 1s, we will have the last 1 unconnected to anyone.

Repeat the process, eventually we will have ungrouped 1s (which is isolated), and unmatched parity of evens (the head of every segment of even, since we only make tail connect to an odd number of 1s, tail parity issue is resolved through that but head remains).

You might be wondering what if we have head = tail, in this scenario we still connect to odd number of 1s, and our head will still have odd parity.


At the end, we will either have 

even number of heads that is in odd parity & even number of ungrouped 1s

odd number of heads that is in odd parity & odd number of ungrouped 1s

Reason is simple, if we have even and odd we would have violated the condition.

Proof :

When we have even groups and odd isolated 1s

total number of odds in the groups = 2k
isolated ones = 2k + 1

which mean it is only possible to have such condition when we have an odd number of 1s.

Same goes to odd groups and even isolated 1s.

At the end,

If we have at least one isolated 1s.

we can use the first isolated 1 to connect to every isolated 1 and every unmatched parity head.

if we have even groups and even isolated 1s, we will have odd number of items to connect to and everyone would have the correct parity after that.

same go to the other case.


If we dont have isolated 1s?

we will have an even number of groups (proven above)

so we use the first head and connect to the rest, which will also make every parity correct.
