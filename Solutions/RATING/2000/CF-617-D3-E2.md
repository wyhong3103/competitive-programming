Wrong Idea : Greedily sort the element, for every character from a to z, for every character i that is bigger than character j that has appeared earlier than the last character of j should have a connection to j, to avoid having the same color. Do the same thing for every character, color of character j is simply the mex of the color of the characters that is is connected to.

This wouldn't work in a case like

cnabcd

Optimal Solution would give 2, but the wrong greedy gives 3.


So how do we solve it??

Claim : We need at least the length of the longest decreasing sequence number of different colors to sort the letters

Since for the longest decreasing sequence, the order of every letter is reversed, in order to swap them back in the correct order, the smallest letter need to go through every letter that is bigger than it, and the second one need to go through every letter bigger than it, and so on.

Claim : the answer is the length of the longest decreasing sequence.

Proof : 

Let's prove that number of colors needed will not exceed 

From dilworth theorem, we know that the minimal number of non-decreasing sequence that covers the entire array is the length of the longest decreasing sequence. So right now, let's imagine that we have all the minimal number of nds that covers the entire array. Notice that we wouldn't swap any element in the same nds. So let's assume, every nds has its own color. To sort the array, we're essentially doing the between groups, and the number of groups is the length of the lds, so we won't have to use more colors than that.


So how do we construct our solution?

We can greedily assign groups.

From left to right, for current element i, connect i to the subsequence that ends with characters smaller or equal to i. And then let i be the new ending letter of that subsequence. At the end, we will get the number of groups = length of lds.
