Let's first talk about our strategy

We always want to make cells in the first column and first row to be of the same size, this is guaranteed to be better than any other paths, since the total number of ways we needed to make them of same size is the smallest because it has the minimal amount of cells.

Let's eliminate some cases first

We can do DP to generate the total moves needed to reduce square of size 2^n to all size 1 for n up to 33.

Not hard to see that when n = 31, total moves needed >= 10^18, so basically for every squares that has length >= 32, we can reduce the square one time, so we have 4 squares of 2^31, and we can just exhaust our moves on the bottom right cell, it is guaranteed that we can always exhaust our moves.

In other scenario, we can bruteforce, make the cells in row 1 and col 1 to be of size n, since n is small!

For every size, we need the [minimal moves we need to make, maximal moves we can make]

Notice that we only prioritize on reducing the cells on the first col/row, so we will ignore the other cells once it is no longer the first col/row.

Playing around with this idea, we can see the way it reduces and count the minimal total moves needed, it follows the cost function we defined below, we need to add every squares that is no longer first col/row to a frequency map. So at the end, we can count how many more moves can we exhaust.

We just need to make sure k lies between the range.
