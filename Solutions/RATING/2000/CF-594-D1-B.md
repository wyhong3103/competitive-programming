given a permutation p, and an array a

q queries

each has l and r

we are to determine whether a[l:r] has a subsequence that is the cyclic shift of permutation p

How to determine if there is a cyclic shift?

If we are to connect (directed edge) every p[i] to p[i+1] in array a, for any subarray, if any two element has a distance >= n, then a cyclic shift of permutation p is in that subarray. 

Not hard to see why this is true

So is there a way to optimally construct a permutation p that has starting number = a[i]?

It is also not hard to see that we should greedily connect current element that has number p[i] to the closest next element that has number p[i+1], this way we would get the shortest cyclic shifted permutation p!

So basically, from the above observation, we can see that each element a[i] would only connect to at most one element! But many element could connect to it.

If every element has only one outgoing edge to element further, that implies there would be one element with no one to point to.

And this is basically a tree.

In fact, if we connect up all the edges, we would get a forest.

So our problem has boiled down to, for each node in the tree, who is the n-th ancestor?

This is a problem that could be solved using binary lifting

Now to answer the query, we can answer it offline

Have a sorted set that stores the end points of the active queries, we fix every left point i of a segment, if there is any query that has l = i, we put it to the sorted set. For every i, we find the nth ancestor and mark every active query that has r >= nth ancestor as 1 and remove it from the set. If there is any query that has r = i, we remove them after answering the query.
