Took me a while to figure it out.

First, it's not hard to see that, it always goes like this

Say representation of n is = x * y * z

We can subtract one of its divisor, let's say y*z

new n = x*(y*z) - (y*z) = (x-1)*(y-z)

Further simplify it, it's just

n = a*b - b = (a-1)*b

Notice that, 

If b is an odd number and a is an even number,

let it be even * odd

Alice should subtract the odd number,

even * odd - odd

so bob gets

odd * odd

Dont matter which side bob subtracts, alice get

even * odd

Alice always get even!

Finally at one point, we're going to have

2 * odd 

alice can - odd, and then win! 

With the above, we can tell that whenever there is a

even * odd, combination, and its alice turn, alice can always win.

Special cases

n is a power of 2, (i.e we cant represent it with odd * even), n > 1

When n is 4

2 * 2, alice can still win, because if she substracts by 2, we get 1 * 2, which bob will lose

When n is 8 ?

2 * 2 * 2

4 * 2, subtract 2, we get

3 * 2, bob gets a even * odd combination, bob will win.

Does that mean when power of 2 is not 4, bob will always win? 

You might be tempted to think the above because 

Whenever we have

even * even - Alice

odd * even - Bob

Bob will win.

But, 

If the odd number is 1?

for example when n = 16

2 * 8, alice can subtract by 8 instead of 2, so we get


1 * 8,

bob gets 8, 4 * 2, which is the number that alice lost! so bob will lose!

To generalize this, when we have a power of 2, and power is even, alice will win, else bob win.
