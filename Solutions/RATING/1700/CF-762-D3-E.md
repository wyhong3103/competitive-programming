Tag : greedy

Our goal is to find for every i, 0 <= i <= n, to find the minimal number of time we need to increment an element, to make the current MEX (smallest missing number) from the array = i.

Observations

1. if the total number in the array that is smaller than i < i, then it's always impossible. This is because we need to form 0...i-1, which is i numbers in total. If we have lesser numbers than that, there is no way we can do it.

2. if i-1 is impossible, any number j >= i-1 is also impossible.

3. If i-1 is possible, there are two cases.

First case, is that in i-1, we incremented i-1 to i (we need to increment all i-1, so that i-1 could be missing from the array!). Now in i, the answer is simply the last answer (i-1's answer) - number of i-1 in the array + number of i in the array (same reason, we need to increment i to i+1, but i-1 could remain there!)

Second case, in i-1, we do not have i-1 (no extra increments were made). But right now, if we want i to be the MEX, we need i-1 to exist in the array, so the idea is, we could greedily find the closest number < i, that has more than 1 element, and increase it to i-1. So the answer for this kind would be last answer + (i - closest number < i that has more than 1 element) + number of i in the array.
