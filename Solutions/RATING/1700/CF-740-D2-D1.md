We can dp it.

For the first operation, where we can do subtraction, that simply mean to reach i, we can come from i+1 to n.

For that, we can simply use prefix sum!

For the other operation, is a little tricky.

Because of the fact that "there are several ways to move the token from one cell to another in one shift, all these ways are considered distinct". So regardless, we have to use every number to divide it. But we have to be smart about it!

Notice that if we were to do it backward, and to reach i,

we can come from 

i*2 to (i*2)+1
i*3 to (i*3)+2
.
.
.
i*j to (i*j)+(j-1)

And we can easily compute the range sum using prefix sum as well!
