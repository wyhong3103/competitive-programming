The idea of solving this problem is literally about building a pyramid as such

  k


from k+1 to the right most, the sum of every element (pillow) would be ((k-1)*(k))/2

from k-1 to the left most, the sum of every element would be the,  sum to right most - ((k-1)-(n-k)) * ((k-1)-(n-1))/2

The reason we're doing that is simple , from 1 to 6 the summation formula is 6(7)/2, we want to find the answer from 4 to 6, we duduct 1 to 3

Then let total = k + k_to_right_most + k_to_left_most

Then every extra pillow below that is simply (m - total)/n, so the final answer would be ((m-total)/n) + k

But we need to take care of a few edge cases, is when total is actually bigger than m, what we need to do, is scale down the pyramid

But remember the problem has stated that every hobbit must have one pillow, so we kind of have to deduct m by n first at the beginning, to make sure the above progress wouldn't affect the result.

There should be a formula to scale down the pyramid, without using the loop. But anyways, my code passed the test with 2 ms away from being TLE, so cool.
```
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define all(x) begin(x),end(x)
#define fir first
#define sec second
#define sz(x) x.size()
#define pb push_back
 
using namespace std;
using vi = vector<int>;
using pi = pair<int,int>;
using ll = long long;
const double EPS = (1e-7);
 
void setio(string s){
	freopen((s + ".in").c_str(),"r",stdin);
	freopen((s + ".out").c_str(),"w",stdout);
}

void solve(){
    ll n, m, k;
    cin >> n >> m >> k;

    //Let k be the highest as it could, symetrically, so it doesn't really matter which is right or left, long as we got it's highest order
    k = max(k, (n-k)+1);

    //every hobbit gets at least one pillow
    m -= n;

    ll right = k-1;
    ll left = (n-k);
    ll right_sm = (right*(right+1))/2;
    ll left_sm = right_sm - (((k-1)-left)*((k-1)-left+1))/2;

    ll total = right_sm+left_sm+k;


    //Scaling down the pyramid
    while (total > m){
    	//The reason we're not deducting it by n
        //We don't want to subtract extra pillow, in cases where the n-th bed has already 0 pillow, 
        total -= (right+left+1);
        if (right == left) left--;
        right--;
        k--;
    }

    // + 1 because the extra one pillow we duducted earlier
    cout << ((m - total)/n) + k + 1;
}

int main(){
	ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
	cin.tie(nullptr);
    solve();
	return 0;
}
