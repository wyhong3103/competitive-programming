We could only connect the chains up, iff the second chain size == 1

With this observation, it literally means the only consecutive group is the group that starts from 1.

Because even though if other groups has consecutive one, but they cannot be connected, so they would have to split up eventually

Splits in an individual chain that doesn't start with 1, is m-1, and the groups splitted is m
For group that starts with 1, split = (m-consecutive elements), groups = (m-consecutive element)+1

So the answer is number of split + (number of groups-1)
