A really cool problem if you understand it.

Problem Simplification

We're given a graph of N barns, there are N-1 cows, there's one cow on each barn, except barn N, each cow wants to go to barn N. And there are K haybales, haybales is on the barns as well. We want to check if a cow can change its path to be at one of the haybales (to eat some grass) from its optimal path to barn N. If there isn't any restriction, of course, a cow can always eat the haybales by just switching course. But, it isn't the case where we do not have any restriction, the restriction is, on each haybales, if we are to switch from the optimal path to node N, the total distance increased should be at most K[i], depending on the haybales.

Solution

First, it is pretty obvious that we need to find the optimal path for each cow to reach barn N first. Which we can treat barn N as the single source with dist[n-1] = 0, and find the shortest path with dijkstra's.

And then, it is the part where we have to find if a cow can switch its course to taste some grass and do not violate the condition at the same time.

Notice that, if we ever been to one of the haybales, our path to barn N, is simply the shortest path of that haybale to barn N.  

Right now, basically we're forcing the shortest path that contains the haybales using dijkstra's. How do we do that ? 

The idea is to start the priority queue with the barn with haybales and it's shortest distance subtract yummy value of the haybale as it's distance. Why? 

The condition is only fulfilled if d-l <= y, (d = shortest distance with haybales, l = shortest distance w/o haybales, y = yummy value)

It is also equivalent to, d-y <= l , which is better, because if we are to simply deal with d-l <= y, we will do have quite some checking during the dijkstras and the final step.
On the contrary, if we are to use d-y as the starting distance, we simply need to check if the final shortest distance of the cow with haybales is smaller or equal to the one w/o forcing on haybales.

With this, we can simply start doing dijkstra's on it, and check the final answer.
