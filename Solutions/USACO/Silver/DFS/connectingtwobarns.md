This is a pretty cool problem, connected components + binary search.
```
So we basically need to connect up the first barn and the last barn, by at most building two new paths.

Before we start talking about the solution, let's dissect this problem further

What does it mean by having at most two path?

There are a few cases that we have to consider

First it's the case where there's only one path needed which we can directly connect the first barn(component) to the last barn(componnet)

Second, it's the case where we need an intermediate barn to help to connect up, and there's a few thing about this we have to take note of

During the search of an intermediate barn, we have to be aware with the fact that the barn we're going to connect to is not just going to be barn that is after a certain node in the first barn, it could be one of the node that is overlapping with the component, for example this case below

1
10 2
1 4
3 10

The optimal solution is to connect 4 with 3 to reach 10

With this observation, we knew that we have to consider both way.

Okay so the main idea is to find the intermediate barn to the first barn and the last barn,	which adds up to a minimal total cost

We're going to iterate through every intermediate connected components, and find the minimal cost we need to connect them up, which is through binary search

To search for the minimal distance, we can use binary search, because each node in one component is sorted(we're going to sort it while we're assigning it into the component)

For example, we're going to pair up the X barn and Y barn

We're going to iterate through each nodes in one of the barn, say it's Y barn, using binary search function (upper_bound), we can find the closest node on the right from X barn to one of the node in Y barn. And also by getting the element before upper_bound we can get the closest node on the left from X barn to the node in Y barn. With this, we're going to look for the minimal distance to connect them up.

We're going to first pair up first barn and last barn, because of the case where they don't need an intermediate barn.

Then, we're going to repeat this action on both first barn with i-th barn, and last barn with i-th barn.

And print the minimal cost.
