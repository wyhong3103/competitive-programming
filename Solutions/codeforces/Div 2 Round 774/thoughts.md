Analysis of this contest:
<br>
- Apparently, I wasn't so prepared for this contest, messed up a lot. A and B is like super easy, but I've messed it up ,because of various issues, like misinterpretation of problem, oversight of not using ll.
- Not much to say, but I've completed my goal, which is to complete B and A, although wasn't in a efficient time. But yea, gon keep grinding!
