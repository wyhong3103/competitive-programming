Damn, this is one big tricky problem, at first, naively, I thought it's just every odd number * 2, and every even number * 3, well it turned out it's wrong! Every odd number * 2 is correct, but the other half is wrong! A counterexample is 6, 6 is both divisible by 2 and 3, so the correct answer for 6 is 4.
```
This problem involved a number theory, like gcd and lcm.

At first, we can solve the first half first, which is multiplying the number of odd number by 2.

Then, we find the number that is divisible by 2 and 3, those are the number that cannot * 3.

It's fairly simple, it's simply just n/(2*3).

And now let n/(2*3) = x, x is the number that is divisible by 2 and 3, 

So the (remaining number(basically the number of even numbers at this point) - x )* 3 , should be added to the answer right now, remaining - x is basically the number that is only divisible by 2 but not 3 , these are the number we can use 3 as the answer.

Now what we do next? We try 4, we find the number that is divisible by 2, 3 and 4. Why? Because these are the numbers that we cannot use 4 as the answer. Well now this is the tricky part, we cannot simply do n/(2*3*4), 2*3*4 would get us 24, but think of 12, 12 is the number that is divisible by 2,3,4. So that doesn't make sense, the only reason that 2*3 works because they're relatively prime to each other. So now we need LCM, to get the number 12. n/12 get us the number that is divisible by 2 3 and 4. So we do the same thing again, let it equal to x, then ans += (remaining - x) * 4.

Now just keep on doing the same thing until remaining is equal to 0.
