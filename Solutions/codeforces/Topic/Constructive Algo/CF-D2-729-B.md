So apparently, we can multiply x by a, and add b. At first, you might be tempted to think that if you do \*a, +b, \*a, +b, over x, is nearly impossible to predict this structure, if we have to brute force it, we literally have to run in 2^n times. But this is actually false, 
```
Let's say we start with x = 1, 

*a, +b, *a, +b, would get us
(a((a)+b))+b

And this would be evaluated to

a^2+ ba + b = a^2 + b(a + 1)

Notice that, it can actually still be constructed by multiplying first, and then only do +b, a+1 times, that means, it isn't necessary to do +b, or *a, then +b, whatsoever. The same step can be done by *a by a number of times, and then only plus b a number of times.

And that's the idea


So a^k + b*x would get us N, if it's possible

a^k + b*x = n

n-a^k = b*x

x = (n-a^k)/b

x has to be an integer
