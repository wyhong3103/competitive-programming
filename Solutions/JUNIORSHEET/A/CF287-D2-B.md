Seemingly easy and short solution took me 5-6 hours to figure it out. Overall a pretty great problem. So we are given a number of splitters, the splitter kind range from 2 to k, so there will be k-1 splitters in total, a splitter with 2 , means that it can get 1 input(water supply) and split it into two output(water supply). And a number, n, which is the number of places we have to connect our pipe to. One water supply can only be connected to 1 splitter. So obviously, we have to connect a splitter to the water supply, and another splitter connect to the splitter, so on and so forth. 
```
Example case #1:
n = 4, k = 3
	.
	|
   /|\

     /\ 

We can simply connect a 1-2 splitter to the 1-3 splitter, and it will form 4 output at the end. Notice that everytime we connect one splitter to another, the total output = total splitter output - 1, because one is used to connect the splitter
```

Approach:
- Before we get into the general cases, let's talk about some special cases.
	Special Cases:
	- When n = 1, answer will always be 0, because we don't need splitter
	- When n <= k, answer will always be 1, because we have 1-n splitter
	- When n > total output of k can be formed , it will be impossible to form the splitter to n, which means, k connect to k-1, k-1 connect to k-2, until 2, the total output we can get is summation(k) - k + 1
	- summation(k)-k, because there are k conjunctions (this will help to exclude 1 as well, but did an extra subtraction on the last splitter, which is without k conjunctions), and + 1 to add it back
- To find the best answer, which is the minimum number of splitter we need to form n output. We don't have to find the exact splitter we're using, but the number of splitter we need. There is one key observation to find this answer.
- Let's say n = 20, k = 7, To know exactly, how many number of splitter we need to fulfill the condition, we can do the following.
```
Let's start by number of splitter = 1,

While we're only allowed to use 1 splitter, we will always choose the maximum, because if the maximum can cover the n, which means > n, that means 1 must be correct, this is because that, even though 7 might not be the answer, but the answer must be within 2 - 7.

But in this case, our n = 20, so its impossible

Say number of splitter allowed = 4,

The best 4 element we got is 4 5 6 7, which the total output we can get is 3 + 4 + 5 + 7, (you can find this using the formula I've provided above), number got deducted because of the conjunctions. 3 + 4 + 5 + 7 = 19, which is certainly not enough, it's still below n. 

number of splitter allowed = 5,

This time, we got 3 4 5 6 7, which gave us a total output of 21. 21 > 20, so 5 will be one of the answer. Notice that we got 21 here, that means we can form 21 by using 2 4 5 6 7. So it's definitely possible.
```

- By using this approach, we can get the answer by using binary search.
- Before we dive deeper, let's denote summation from 2 to i-j, and deducted the conjunction by summation(i,j)
- To get the total output stated above, we can use the formula , summation(k,0) - summation(k,mid) + 1. This basically gives us the value we're looking for.
```
Basically, the approach:

summation(7, 0) (with the previous example)
2 3 4 5 6 7 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 7 = 22

summation(7, 4)
Element included is only the 1-2, because we got 6 element and excluded 5
1 + 3 = 4


22 - 4 + 1 = 19, the reason we need to + 1 , is because the 1-3 is actually being used as a conjunction as well, we need to consider that!
```
- By looking at these observations, we can simply do binary search across the search space, and as usual, get the first element that is >= n, (>= n , that means it's definitely possible to use the amount of splitters).
