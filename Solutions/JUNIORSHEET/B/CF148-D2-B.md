This problem is simply stupid. Glad that it didn't fail me because I wasn't using epsilon for floating number comparison. Anyways, everything has to be exact. Moment where dragon is going to get the princess has to be the exact moment/distance they met each other. We can simply get the formula using v = d/t , explanation to my solution is in below
```
Travel as usual, if the dragon is not going to catch the princess in the next hour.

If dragon is going to catch the princess, 

princess location - ......
dragon location   - ...

They are probably going to meet somewhere before the next landing of both of them

To find the exact distance, we need to use the distance formula

v = d/t

To find the location where they are going to meet

v_p = d/t

v_d = d + (p-d) / t

Distance from princess to dragon and the distance where they met, which is d in princess's case

The time is going to be the same , so after rearranging the formula as t = t, we're going to get

d = - (v_p(p-d) / (v_p - v_d))

Everything when this occur, we need to set the dragon to the distance where they met, because this is when the princess is going to drop the bijou to delay the dragon. Also the distance of princess has to be set at this exact distance as well

Then, everything goes back as usual, another special thing we need to concern about is when the dragon is travelling back to where he from. If the distance he at and the distance he is going to travel is more than what it needs to be back at 0, we need to consider this as well. We can do almost the same thing, just get the time to reach there, and set princess at new location, so that everything could go normal again(which is travel by hour and hour).

Until the princess reach c.
