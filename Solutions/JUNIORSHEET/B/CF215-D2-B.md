Ain't hard, it's just the formula, I have to look it up on google, to figure out the formula for density , volume and mass. Although, the SI Unit is already given, but I didn't realised that xD. Anyways the problem is about finding the best r2 we could that fits the ratio after substituting.
```
Explanation

Formula of density,
p = m/v

Ratio A/B = mass outer/ mass inner

One tricky part about this problem is that, the outer mass is equal to p1(pi * r_1^2 * h) - p1(pi * r_2^2 * h)

Inner mass = p2(pi * r_2^2 * h)

After cancelling out the unncessary constant

It became

p1(r_1^2 - r_2^2) / p2 * r_2^2  = A / B

After rearranging the equation, we got

r_2 = sqrt((B * p1 * r_1^2) / (A * p2) + (B * p1))

In order to get r_2 to the maximum, we need to make sure the numerator is as big as possible, and the denominator is as small as possible. We can easily do this, by selecting the largest r_1 and smallest p_2. But what about p_1? After experimenting with a few sample case, I found out that p1 has to be biggest as well in order to make it the maximum, so that's the solution.

	freopen((s + ".in").c_str(),"r",stdin);
	freopen((s + ".out").c_str(),"w",stdout);
}

void solve(){
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    ll r1 = 0;
    for(int i{}; i < n; i++){
        ll r;
        cin >> r;
        r1 = max(r1, r);
    }

    int m;
    cin >> m;
    ll p1 = 0;
    for(int i{}; i < m; i++){
        ll p;
        cin >> p;
        p1 = max(p1, p);
    }

    int k;
    cin >> k;
    ll p2 = 5001;
    for(int i{}; i < k; i++){
        ll p;
        cin >> p;
        p2 = min(p2, p);
    }

    ll A, B;
    cin >> A >> B;

    cout << setprecision(12) << fixed;

    double ans = sqrt((double)(B * p1 * r1 * r1) / ((A * p2) + (B * p1)));
    cout << ans;
}


int main(){
	ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
	cin.tie(nullptr);
	solve();
	return 0;
}
