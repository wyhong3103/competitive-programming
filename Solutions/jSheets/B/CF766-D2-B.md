We basically just have to check if a+b > c, if this is true, we can basically say we can form a triangle. 
<br>
You might have questions such as, <br>
How'd you always guarantee 3 consective line segments that are sorted can always be a triangle, why couldn't it be something like (index) 1 2 4. Well we can prove this with some simple math,
```
Say we got after sorting

1 2 3 4 5 6 7

Notice that we can form 2 + 3 > 4, any number lower than 2 or 3, will not get us number > 4, 

With 4 and 5 , our third line segments can either be 6 or 7, 

With these observations, we can basically tell that 3 consecutive line segmentes(sorted), can always be a triangle, if they're able to.
