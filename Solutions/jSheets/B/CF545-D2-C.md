Actual first solve on dp!! Now let's dissect this problem
```
So the idea of dp is really just, only visit every node once! (Think of it as a DAG)

Now the DP state for this problem is either it fell to the right, left, or do not fall

So there is N*3 state, space complexity is O(N), time complexity is also O(N)

The transition(which I am not so sure about), is probably just getting the max of the next path that we can visit

There's a few part of this problem that I am missing initially which leads to WA
	- In some state, the transition to state 2(trees fall to the left) shouldn't be considered, if the next tree(the tree that we're about to transition to) couldn't fall to the left, or else we would be considering the wrong transition which would lead to WA
	- We should only consider state 2 when it can falls to the left, this is the submission where I made this mistake

Recursive Formula:
	dp(n, state) -> 0
	dp(i,state) -> (if the current tree can be cutten down) + max(dp(i+1, 0), dp(i+1,1), dp(i+1, 2) (only consider if the next tree can fall to the left) ) 
```
My solution could probably be shorten down, with better ways of solving it.
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define all(x) begin(x),end(x)
#define fir first
#define sec second
#define sz(x) x.size()
#define pb push_back
 
using namespace std;
using vi = vector<int>;
using pi = pair<int,int>;
using ll = long long;
const double EPS = (1e-7);
 
void setio(string s){
	freopen((s + ".in").c_str(),"r",stdin);
	freopen((s + ".out").c_str(),"w",stdout);
}

const int MAX = 1e5;
int n;
vector<pi> trees;
int dp[MAX][3];

int recur(int i, int state, int prev){
    if (dp[i][state] != -1) return dp[i][state];

    dp[i][state] = 0;

    if (state == 1) dp[i][state] = (i < n-1 ? (trees[i].fir+trees[i].sec) < trees[i+1].fir : 1);
    else if (state == 2) dp[i][state] = ((trees[i].fir-trees[i].sec) > prev);

    //Previous tree would only be affected , if the trees fall to the right or else it's just the tree coordinate
    prev = (state == 1 && dp[i][state] ? trees[i].fir+trees[i].sec : trees[i].fir);

    //only visit if tree can be cutten down
    if (i+1 == n) return 0;
    else return dp[i][state] += max({recur(i+1, 0, prev), recur(i+1, 1, prev), (prev < (trees[i+1].fir-trees[i+1].sec) ? recur(i+1, 2, prev) : 0)});
}


void solve(){    
    cin >> n;

    trees.resize(n);
    for(auto& i : trees) cin >> i.fir >> i.sec;

    memset(dp, -1, sizeof(dp));
    
    //0 = not falling, 1 = falling right, 2 = falling left
    recur(0, 0 ,-INT_MAX);
    recur(0, 1 ,-INT_MAX);
    recur(0, 2 ,-INT_MAX);
    cout << max({dp[0][0], dp[0][1], dp[0][2]});
}
 
int main(){
	ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
	cin.tie(nullptr);
    solve();
	return 0;
}
