Not a so-tough problem, it's just annoying.
```
We simply need to greedy on this question.

First we could take the biggest step we could, minimize the total steps we have to take, if the ceil(s/n-1) is smaller than k or s < k, then it's impossible

If it's possible, we would need to break it down to a few cases

First , if s % n-1 <= k - (s/n-1), that means we can split s % n-1, as a step of 1 to all the remaining ks excluding the big step that we're taking. If there's still k remainng , we would need to take down some big step, and break it down to small step, in order to fulfil the ks. If s % n-1 > k, then we can evenly split it over all the reamining ks.

We just have to keep track of the steps, and then take the big step first because it's going to make sure we ends at the beginning/end and it gives us the most space to travel, then sort the extra k steps from bigger to smaller, we take the big step first, this is because,

If we are to take the small step first, say 1 -> 5, and then the next step length is n-1 which is a big step, there's no way we could travel it.
