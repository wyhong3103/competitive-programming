This is a pretty okay problem. Below is the explantion to my solution.
```
So apparently we want to construct a string from a multiset, that will cost exactly k

For example,

12

a b a b a b a b

{"ab", "a", "b", "a", "b", "a", "b"}, with a cost of 0;
{"aba", "b", "a", "b", "a", "b"}, with a cost of 1;
{"abab", "a", "b", "a", "b"}, with a cost of 1;
{"abab", "ab", "a", "b"}, with a cost of 0;
{"abab", "aba", "b"}, with a cost of 1;
{"abab", "abab"}, with a cost of 1;
{"abababab"}, with a cost of 8.

The total cost is 12, and it can be proved to be the minimum cost of the process.

This is what shown in the example,

If you paid enoguh attention, you will realize that the way you concatenate the string, doesn't matter, you can do it like this as well

a a a a b b b b 

aa a a b b b b - 1
aaa a b b b b - 2
aaaa b b b b - 3
aaaa bb b b - 1
aaaa bbb b - 2
aaaa bbbb - 3
aaaabbbb - 0

Okay another observation, any n same characters being grouped up will eventually cost the summation from 1 to n-1.

So the idea is fairly simple now, we just have to take advantage of this fact. We will try to partition k into groups of summation series

12 to 10, 1, 1

10 = 1 to 4
1 = 1 to 1

So the alternative answer is aaaaabbcc, every letters need to have an extra character.

	freopen((s + ".in").c_str(),"r",stdin);
	freopen((s + ".out").c_str(),"w",stdout);
}

void solve(){
    int k;
    cin >> k;

    vi res;

    if (k == 0) cout << 'a';

    while(k){
        int lo = 1, hi = 1000;
        while (hi > lo){
            int mid = lo + (hi-lo+1)/2;
            int sm = (mid*(mid+1))/2;
            if (sm > k){
                hi = mid-1; 
            }else{
                lo = mid;
            }
        }

        k -= (lo*(lo+1))/2;
        res.pb(lo+1);
    }
    

    for(int i{}; i < sz(res); i++){
        while (res[i]--){
            cout << (char)('a'+i);
        }
    }
}

int main(){
	ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
	cin.tie(nullptr);
    solve();
	return 0;
}
