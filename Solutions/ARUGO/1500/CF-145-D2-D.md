This is a pretty annoying problem, because of the edge cases.

Okay, let's talk about what the problem is asking first

We are to identify whether a movie, is for sure vasya's favourite, maybe or not

A movie is vasya's favourite if
There's no movie has more favourite actor than that movie

A movie is probably vasya's favourite if
The movie probable favourite actors is the most

A movie is definitely not vasya's favourite if
The movie favourite actor is the most

Okay how do we identify them?

First off, we can have an array that stores the minimum and maximum favourite actors of a movie, because some movie has unidentified actors

For each movie

minimum = number of identified favourite actors + max(0,unidentified actors - unfavourable actors that hasn't been counted yet)

Say we have 5 actors, 3 are favourite actors, and we have a movie with 3 unidentified actors
There will be 1 fav actors included in the movie, why?

_ _ _ , the maximum hole we can fill with unfav actors are 2, that's why

maximum = number of identified actors + min(unidentified actors, favourable actors that hasn't been counted yet)

After completed this, we need to record down the largest & second largest maximum, and also the largest minimum among all of the movies

Movies with the minimum >= 2nd largest maximum (because we cannot just consider the maximum, as it might be this movie's maximum) and it's maximum >= maximum, is guaranteed to be the favourite movie

Movie that is bigger than the largest minium, could potentially be the favourite movie

else not
