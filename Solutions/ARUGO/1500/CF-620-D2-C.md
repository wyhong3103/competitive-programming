Finally a good problem.
```
So the problem is basically about whether it's possible to adjust the temperature and fulfill every customer's requirement.

Now, if you're simply thinking of doing this

if (previous customer time - current customer time >= temperature difference of current and desired temperature)

Then you're wrong. Because below is one of the case that this method might fail

5 0

1 0 5 
2 0 5
3 0 5
4 0 5
5 0 5
6 6 10

With the code above, the current temperature is going to stay as 0, so when it meets 6 it's impossible to do it. But the optimal move is to actually just keep on increasing the temperature because it's in the bound, then at 6-th second, it will reach 6

Now this method takes me a little time to figure it out, but the idea is to literally just keep track of the possible bound of the current temperature

Now let's take the above example and demonstrate how it works

So at 0-th minute , our temperature = 0, so the current bound is [0,0]

At 1st minute, our temperatere could be at [0-1,0+1], [-1,1], but apparently the bound at that instant is is at [0,5], so we wouldn't consider -1, so it'd be [0,1]

At 2nd minute, it could be at [0-1, 1+1] -> [-1,2], but bound is [0,5] so [0,2]

.
.
.

At 5th minute, it could be at [0-1, 4+1] -> [0, 5]

Now at 6-th minute, it be at [0-1,5+1] -> [-1,6], but the bound is [6,10], so we would need to shrink our active region to [6,6]

Now to determine whether it's possible to fulfill a certain temperature, we could use the intersection technique

min(upper_bound1,upper_bound2) - max(lower_bound1, lower_bound2) , if the answer is >= 0, that means it intersected, so it's possible
