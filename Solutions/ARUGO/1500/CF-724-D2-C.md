Okay, I did not solve this problem, but the idea behind it is literally, return the number of element at prefix i, that has the same ratio at that point.
```
Apparently, using 

9 : 6

9/GCD(9,6) : 6/GCD(9,6)

3 : 2

Gives us the simplest ratio, one thing that I didn't notice and I didn't know we need

So why does simply returning the number of element that has the same ratio at prefix i works?

Take this as an example, at i = 3, we're going to add 1 to {2,1}, then at i = 6, we're going to add another 1 to {2,1}, at the end we also going to add 1 to {2,1}, so the final answer at the end of the array, will be 3 

This takes good observation, that's what im missing from this problem.
