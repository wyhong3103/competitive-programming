The idea of this problem is not so obvious, at least not for me, because I am not a big combinatorics fan. Anyways, here is the solution.
```
So we are to find the number of strictly increasing subsequences, such that every element has to be the character 'a', and in between them has to be 'b'

For example,

abbaa

1 could pair up with 4, 1 could pair up with 5, but 4 couldn't pair up with 5 because there's no 'b' in between them.
And also we have to consider the element itself, 1, 4 , 5 are also strictly increasing subsequence

So the idea is to simply form such a thing

(Number of 'a' before 1st b) b (unmber of 'a' between 1st b and 2nd b) b....... (number of 'a' after the last b)

It is clear that we basically need to find the number of subset, with the above, but it's not that simple, we cannot simply do 2^n, because we have to consider the number of 'a' in each segment

So what we can do is +1, to every segment, as an empty element, placeholder, blank element, whatever you call it. Because

if we have ,

ababa

One of the increasing subsequence is

1, 5

a___a

The a between them, is just seems like it's an empty element and all

So with basic product rule, we can do number of element+1 in first box, then find the multiplication of all the boxes, and then finally -1, because we have to consider the case where all element selected are empty

    int cur = 0;
    for(auto& i : s){
        if (i == 'a') cur++;
        if (i == 'b'){
            a.pb(cur+1);
            cur = 0;
        }
    }
    if (cur > 0) a.pb(cur+1);

    ll res = 1;
    for(auto& i : a){
        res = (res * i) % MOD;
    }

    res = (((res - 1) + MOD )% MOD);
    cout << res;

    solve();
	return 0;
