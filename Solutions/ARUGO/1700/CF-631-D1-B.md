A combinatorics problem.

We are to find the number of arrays that satisfy the conditions below

- array of length n, n >= 1, n is not given, it can be any
- an increasing array, but a_n never bigger than d
- such that an array b that is constructed from a
b[1] = a[1], b[i] = b[i-1] XOR a[i], and it should result in an increasing array


Observations
- b[1] = a[1], b[2] = b[1] XOR a[2], which is just equivalent to b[2] = a[1] XOR a[2], the same goes for b[3], it's just a[1] XOR a[2] XOR a[3]
- In order for b[2] > b[1], there must exist a bit in a[2] that is bigger than any bits	of b[1], or else XOR is going to cancel out the biggest bit (assume they have the same leading bit), and it's going to result in b[1] > b[2]. From this we can tell that there must exist a bigger leading bit in a[i] than a[i-1], the same thing goes for b[3]

So right now, it's basically just about finding the number of ways to form such an array, such that a[i] has a bigger leading bit than a[i-1]

We can model the problems into bit

Say d = 4, there will be 3 bits in total, and all the possible sequences are

001
001, 010
001, 011
001, 100
001, 010, 100
001, 011, 100
010
010, 100
011
011, 100
100

Notice that every number in that sequence has a different leading bits, more formally, for each bit i there is exactly 2^i number of number that we can use for that bit

Initially, I was going to use contribution to the sum technique to solve this problem, but it was too complicated.

Instead, I found a greater way to do the combinatorics

For each bit i, we can iterate from bit j to i, j <= i, and multiply the 2^j along the way, because there is exactly 2^j number of ways we can use that bit, but we need to +1 for each j except for j == i, as an empty bit. This is basically used for counting the number of arrays that bit i exist in, that's why we do not need to +1 to bit i.
